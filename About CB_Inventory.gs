Now, I haven't created all this by myself. I have found a lot of bits by Googling, but I have also had help from people on various forums.
The combined end result is of course my baby, but you are free to copy and re-use any parts of this as you please. No need to credit me.
I did figure out how to put this on my github. :-)

Here's a link to the wiki.
