# CB_Inventory
A Google Apps Script using Google Sheets to manage Chrome devices in a G Suite domain.

The scripts can't do anything at all until you authorise them.

I've run the export from a domain with 34 300 devices, without getting a time-out. It did take a while, but it kept going till it was done.

GAM can, of course, do all this, but it requires a steady hand.

This little thing works great with copy/paste, and a simple menu with few options.
